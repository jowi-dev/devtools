# Daily Note
## Key Takeaways

## Log
Built up a function to rebuild my neovim environment today. This allows for full sourcing, but has the draw back of needing to opt into that sourcing. Maybe a future improvements to source files automatically given a root directory.

Learned about functions and how they are loaded into memory thanks to nix and nvim; Was rebuilding an environment for hours trying to figure out why sourcing seemed broken. Thought defering the source call would help guarantee that nix had finished copying files to the new config directory. That wasn't the issue at all. The issue was the calling function was already loaded onto the (.. stack? heap? TODO - learn which) and so the `old version` would be called because it was already. Hard to hot reload a function mid call.

GPT is a huge boon in my workflow, and could use some touchups. I think conversation history, as well as a less hap-hazard way of inserting/receiving questions would be helpful. Context will eventually be important, doubly so if tooling is ever localized.

Finally have a note taking app inside vim. init.
