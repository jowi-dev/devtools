_Copy for work and home if needed_
## Stated Intentions
Ideally today I would like to ship and enable this CIO PR. If that happens I'll move to enabling it and monitoring it for 30min at the end
of the day to make sure there's nothing exploding. Otherwise I'll use that time to investigate tech debt and plan how to derisk changing it.

UpdateTaskStatus mutation will enable admin functionality so we don't have to rely on the pal team to correct any mistakes 

## Schedule

## Actual Completions
- Shipped CIO Work
- Enabled Interviews
- QA'd a PR

## Summary
This one was pretty smooth. A little note on making your schedule dependent on what other people can do; not ideal. Focus more on
what you can get done, and schedule in what others can do in the next day or the day after. That way you can maintain your schedule
day to day without needing to be reactive.

## For Tomorrow
- Check CIO logs to make sure the jobs ran and the results are what was expected
- Take a look into Pal Task cleanup and see what can be done there
- Go back to updateTaskStatus for admins - do we need this? Do we even want this? **FOR DSU**
- if yes, do ^. if no, do Notification tech debt work
