_Copy for work and home if needed_
## Stated Intentions
Compliance Docs in Review

CIO in a place where I can defend it
- Packager is broken causing fields to not generate correctly
- BuildCIOUpdates is streaming from a CSV but immediately turning that into an enum and crashing the process
- Creating a Cache table each morning is a hit on performance that doesn't need to happen
- These jobs don't need to go into an individual queue, but an Oban.Pro.Workers.ChunkWorker to handle bulk updates
- The update/delete job makes it through exactly one pass of the cache table before crashing - full count 2/8 was 55061, count after failure was 54561 with 500 jobs processed, the size of one batch
