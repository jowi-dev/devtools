- Architecture

The neovim api is getting a lot easier to traverse, and giving myself time to build tools feels like it will net a big win in the future. Built out a tool to make GQL requests, and although its not perfect by any stretch its not bad for an MVP. As a bonus, the output function in that module will be good for the GPT module as a way to create a better dialogue. Maybe a floating window would do better?

Opt-in reloading is brittle. It will work for now but this singleton architecture of this (currently) will eventually implode if I don't find a better way to manage adding new functionality. Maybe fat contexts for nvim is the way as well.

I'm still a bit gun-shy on nix configs; gonna have to cut my teeth sometime.
