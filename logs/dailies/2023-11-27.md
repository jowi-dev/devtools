- started revising my http approach in neovim to be more command line dependent as opposed to being
  language dependent. This means that in the future CLI tools will become relevant a la jober's 
  bash-gpt method. This feels substantially better over having to fight neovim to make it 
  run everything through lua. Ideally m entire environment can be a collection of bash commands
  glued together by lua/neovim


- Arcan (arcan-fe.com) looks to be the winning candidate for a forward thinking display server, but there's still plenty of work to be done in the realm of researching Wayland. I'm hesistant to adopt xorg since there is not much active development around it, and hesitant around Wayland since there is no largescale adoption despite a decade of massive efforts and development. Arcan's obvious drawback is commmunity size, but the merit in the way of its architecture (from a high level) seems to show that it can actually be a viable candidate inspite of that.


- Roadmaps on projects are as follows
    - neovim: hammercurl needs to use curl rather than lua methods. 
    - nix: flake experiments on backend at work for fetchFromGithub will be a good POC
    - nix: fModa3's work around setup seems to be a winner given sufficiently many neovim setups.
        this likely will deem an annoying migration, but if rolling forward with the OS is the desired outcome, there isn't much way around it.
    - GameDev: POC for the raylib game due, and slowing to a crawl for now
