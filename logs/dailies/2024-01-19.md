## Stated Intentions
- CIO work needs to be in a QA-able state. That should just mean copy/pasting the old implementation

Personal: Fork Telekasten and add Incident checklist feature?

## Actual Completions
- [x] QA-able state CIO PR

## Summary
Notes started on the right foot. This boosted my ability to focus on my day and cut out noise pretty significantly.I think `Scratch` and maybe `For Tomorrow` would be helpful sections to add to help with organization and fluidity respectively. Adding

## For Tomorrow (work)
- UpdateWaitingRoomTaskStatus Refactor
- Ship CIO changes

Personal: Fork Telekasten and add Incident checklist feature?
Personal: Fork Telekasten and add `goto next workday` feature to remove this section
Personal: Fork Telekasten and make `Personal` ideas carry over, or move somewhere they won't get lost
Personal: Worth adding `Learned` as a section here? 
Personal: Note-Sync command to auto push these logs

### Test Steps for CIO
#### Part 1: Run the commands without the flag enabled

##### Feature Flags UI
[Link](https://cope-pixel.backend.papadev.co/dev-tools/feature-flags/flags/customer_io_sync_v2)
- Ensure the feature is **Disabled**
##### Console
[link](https://cope-pixel.backend.papadev.co/console/)
- Boot up the console for the review app, run the following commands one by one
- `export CUSTOMERIO_SYNC_ENABLED=true`
    * Shouldn't print anything
- `iex -S mix`
    * Will start the elixir console
- `PapaPal.Cron.CustomerIOSync.process(%Oban.Job{})`
    * Ensure that `:ok` is printed in the console
#### Oban Jobs Dashboard

- Ensure that there are CustomerIO jobs in there

- Ensure there are no CustomerIO jobs in here
