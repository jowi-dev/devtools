_Copy for work and home if needed_
## Stated Intentions

- need to determine what the pagination data looks like when returning from CIO
- need to determine how changesets will be handled when sending data to customerIO
- [x] need to complete testing on cio data

## Schedule


09:00 AM-10:30 AM - CIO Heads Down: Finish testing query

11:00 AM-12:00 PM Break/Lunch
12:00 PM-01:00 PM - CIO Heads Down: Build/Test Changeset functionality for update PT 1.
01:00 PM-02:00 PM Product / Technology All Hands
02:00 PM-03:00 PM Backend Community

03:30 PM-04:00 PM Break/Run/Clean if needed
04:00 PM-05:00 PM - CIO Heads Down: Build/Test Changeset functionality for update PT 2.

## Actual Completions
- The CIO query. Rather expensive and hard to test, ended up having to add a decent amount of 
   testing to the suite in order to make sure each field was exactly how it needed to be.
   this meant I didn't get quite as far on the changeset functionality as I would have liked,
   but it felt like the right use of time. Getting this absolutely spot on was critical to this
   not being a constant pain

## Summary


## For Tomorrow
- need to determine what the pagination data looks like when returning from CIO
- need to determine how changesets will be handled when sending data to customerIO
