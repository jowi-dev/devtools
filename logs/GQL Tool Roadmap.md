# GQL Nvim Tester

## Stated Intent
To bring the functionality of Insomnia to neovim, so that APIs can be tested from a reliable environment.

## Roadmap
[x] Basic POST'ing of a GQL Request
[x] Body Dumping Adequately
[x] Grabbing Token from an auth request and caching it for future requests
  * Maybe this can be done as an env variable? Maybe an in memory cache is overkill?
[x] Leveraging a .gitignored folder per-project as a repo for these queries
  * This would be the same idea as insomnia's query lib, just with the ability to source it under the relevant repo
[x] Bonus: Make it pretty - Floating window the result, split window the result; something where the input/output would be easy to digest and easy to yank to clipboard as needed
