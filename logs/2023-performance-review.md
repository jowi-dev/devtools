# 2023 Performance Review - Papa

## Please provide 2-3 specific examples of this person's impact on team, department, and organization goals over the last year.
- Joe has delivered on a mountain of things this year.  It’s very impressive just how much he has been able to accomplish.  From his work on Push Notifications, visit cancellation, visit search, all the Trust and Safety projects, the CIO rewrite, and so much more Joe has been an absolute workhorse this year.

- Joe jumps in whenever and wherever he is needed without hesitation.  He works BE, and has even done some mobile work.  His flexibility has been invaluable to the team.

- I have appreciated Joe’s approach to our technology stack.  He doesn’t treat it like a mobile app and a BE app but one system working together.  This mentality generates better outcomes as a whole for our users.

## Describe 1 value that this person continuously demonstrated over the last year.
- I agree with Joe’s self-reflection when he chose “Brave.”  He routinely takes on work that needs to get done without any hesitation.  Even jumping into the mobile code base when needed.  There have been many times that he will take on something, find that it is much larger than initially thought, but still doesn’t back down and powers through it.

## Describe 2-3 skills you'd like this person to acquire, develop, or refine over the next year.
- Work life balance - Joe is a workhorse and that is really great to have on the team but he is burning himself out.  He needs to internalize that an overloaded team is not his problem to manage.  It’s mine.

- Saying no / focus - Joe will at times take on too many things at once.  This causes some of the work that he does have to stagnate a bit.  I would like Joe to focus on fewer things concurrently and that is going to mean saying no to some stuff.  He should work with me when that comes up and we can prioritize appropriately.
